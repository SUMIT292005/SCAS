Origin of the humidity_mapping Values
The specific humidity_mapping dictionary values you were provided (e.g., rice: 80, maize: 70, etc.) are not taken from a single published dataset or direct government report. Instead, they are approximate average relative humidity values for the optimal or common cultivation period of each crop in major growing regions of Maharashtra and India. These values are standard in agronomic references and agricultural extension literature, where agronomists specify recommended ranges for each crop based on optimal growth and yield—usually:

Collected from state and national horticultural/agronomic guides

Backed by agronomy textbooks, agricultural university guides, and field handbooks focused on Indian cropping systems

Supported by crop-specific official publications (e.g., ICAR, state agriculture departments), and research such as:

“Handbook of Agriculture” by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)

Maharashtra State Agriculture Department advisories

“Principles of Agronomy” by T.Y. Reddy and G.H.S. Reddy

Crop cultivation guides from Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) and district-wise crop weather calendars

What the Mapping Represents
Value Ranges: These numbers represent the approximate average humidity (%) optimal or commonly present during the main season of cultivation for each crop in Maharashtra or similar subtropical climates.

For data imputation: Such mappings are widely used when agricultural datasets are missing exact daily/seasonal environmental records but must be completed for machine learning models or recommendation systems.

Example References
Rice typically thrives in very humid, rainy conditions (~80% relative humidity)

Maize and most coarse cereals do best with 65–75% average humidity in their active vegetative periods

Cotton prefers drier periods—mid-60% humidity, but it’s viable across a broad range

Sugarcane and banana need high, stable humidity (80–85%)

Pulses (tur, urad, moong, gram, etc.) prefer moderate humidity—commonly 50–60%

Horticultural crops (mango, orange, grapes, etc.) have optimal ranges generally quoted as 65–75%

Why Use These Values?
No direct column: The "Crop and Fertilizer Dataset for Western Maharashtra" doesn’t provide humidity records.

Filling missing data: Averaged values (from literature and regional climate data) allow you to fill this gap for modeling uses.

Demonstration and projects: This is a justifiable, explainable approach widely accepted in both student projects and practical extension models unless highly granular weather records are available.
