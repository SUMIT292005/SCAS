🧾 Disease Classes to Include
🌿 Cotton (Maharashtra: Vidarbha, Marathwada)

Major cotton diseases in Maharashtra (and covered in open datasets):

Bacterial Blight (Xanthomonas campestris)

Alternaria Leaf Spot / Target Spot (Alternaria macrospora)

Powdery Mildew (Leveillula taurica)

Curl Virus (CLCuV)

Aphid/Armyworm Damage (insect-related, often included in Kaggle datasets)

Healthy Cotton Leaf

➡️ Suggested: Pick 4–5 major classes (Blight, Target Spot, Powdery Mildew, Curl Virus, Healthy).

🍅 Tomato (one of the richest PlantVillage crops)

Available & common tomato leaf diseases:

Early Blight (Alternaria solani)

Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans)

Septoria Leaf Spot (Septoria lycopersici)

Leaf Mold (Fulvia fulva)

Bacterial Spot (Xanthomonas spp.)

Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV)

Healthy Tomato Leaf

➡️ Suggested: Pick 5–6 classes (Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Curl Virus, Mosaic Virus, Septoria, Healthy).

🌱 Soybean (Maharashtra: Marathwada, Vidarbha)

Common diseases (PlantVillage + ICAR datasets):

Rust (Phakopsora pachyrhizi)

Bacterial Pustule (Xanthomonas axonopodis)

Downy Mildew (Peronospora manshurica)

Healthy Soybean Leaf

➡️ Suggested: Pick 3–4 classes (Rust, Bacterial Pustule, Downy Mildew, Healthy).

🌽 Maize (Corn)

PlantVillage & Kaggle datasets generally include:

Northern Leaf Blight (NLB) (Exserohilum turcicum)

Common Rust (CR) (Puccinia sorghi)

Gray Leaf Spot (GLS) (Cercospora zeae-maydis)

Healthy Maize Leaf

➡️ Suggested: Keep 4 classes (NLB, Rust, GLS, Healthy).

✅ Final Recommendation (Balanced + Available in Datasets)

Cotton → Bacterial Blight, Target Spot/Alternaria, Powdery Mildew, Curl Virus, Healthy

Tomato → Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Curl Virus, Mosaic Virus, Septoria, Healthy

Soybean → Rust, Bacterial Pustule, Downy Mildew, Healthy

Maize → Northern Leaf Blight, Common Rust, Gray Leaf Spot, Healthy

👉 That’s around 17–18 classes total, well within CNN capacity.
